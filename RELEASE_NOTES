--------------------
Major update to M5 including:
- New CPU model
- New memory system
- More extensive python integration
- Preliminary syscall emulation support for MIPS and SPARC
This is a *beta* release, meaning that some features are not complete,

coherence).  We are working to address these limitations and hope to
have a complete 2.0 release soon.
