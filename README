WHAT'S INCLUDED (AND NOT)
-------------------------

The basic source release includes these subdirectories:
 - m5: 
   - src: source code of the m5 simulator
   - test: regression tests
   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build m5
   - system/alpha: source for Alpha console and PALcode

To run full-system simulations, you will need compiled console,
PALcode, and kernel binaries and one or more disk images.  These files
are collected in a separate archive, m5_system_2.0.tar.bz2.  This file
is included on the CD release, or you can download it separately from
Sourceforge.

M5 supports Linux 2.4/2.6, FreeBSD, and the proprietary Compaq/HP
Tru64 version of Unix. We are able to distribute Linux and FreeBSD
bootdisks, but we are unable to distribute bootable disk images of
Tru64 Unix. If you have a Tru64 license and are interested in
obtaining disk images, contact us at m5-dev@eecs.umich.edu.

The CD release includes a few extra goodies, such as a tar file
containing doxygen-generated HTML documentation (html-docs.tar.gz), a
set of Linux source patches (linux_m5-2.6.8.1.diff), and the scons
program needed to build M5.  If you do not have the CD, the same HTML
documentation is available online at http://m5.eecs.umich.edu/docs,
the Linux source patches are available at
http://m5.eecs.umich.edu/dist/linux_m5-2.6.8.1.diff, the scons
program is available from http://www.scons.org, and swig is available from
http://www.swig.org.
