This is release m5_1.0_beta1 of the M5 simulator.

This file contains brief "getting started" information and release
notes.  For more information, see http://m5.eecs.umich.edu.  If you
have questions, please send mail to m5sim-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

WHAT'S INCLUDED (AND NOT)
-------------------------

Since you're reading this file, presumably you've managed to untar the
distribution.  The archive you've unpacked has three subdirectories:
 - m5: the simulator itself
 - m5-test: regression tests and scripts to run them
 - ext: less-common external packages needed to build m5
   (currently just "ply")

Although M5 is capable of full-system simulation, the only OS it
currently supports is the proprietary Compaq/HP Tru64 version of Unix.
We are thus unable to distribute bootable disk images freely.  If you
have a Tru64 license and are interested in obtaining disk images,
contact us at m5-dev@eecs.umich.edu.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

The following steps will build and test the simulator.  The variable
"$top" refers to the top directory where you've unpacked the files,
i.e., the one containing the m5, m5-test, and ext directories.

cd $top/m5/setup
./setup ALPHA		# set up build/ALPHA directory
cd $top/m5/build/ALPHA
make m5.opt		# use "-j N" if you've got an MP system
# wait for build...
cd $top/m5-test
./do-tests.pl -B ALPHA	# test what you just built
# wait for tests to run...
# should end with "finished do-tests successfully!"

If you run into errors regarding m5/arch/alpha/decoder.cc, just
"touch" that file to update its timestamp.  This file is generated
from a compact ISA description using a program written in Python.  If
you have Python 2.2.2 or later installed on your system, you should be
able to generate it yourself, but if you don't have Python (or have an
older version), you may run in to trouble.  Since we've shipped a
working copy of decoder.cc, it's not necessary to have Python to build
M5 (unless you start modifying the ISA decription).  Unfortunately,
sometimes make gets confused and tries to do so anyway.  The "touch"
should convince make to stop trying.
